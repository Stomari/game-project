  <h1><strong>Seal Simulator:</strong> Game project in JS!</h1>

  <p>In this project I utilized JavaScript to make a Runner, which the main objective is survive and challenge yourself on getting the highest scores. To do so, I used classes and objects in JS to give my character moving and jumping mechanics, and also create obstacles with different type of movement to make it more challenging to the player.</p>
 <p>The score is calculated by the sum of the time you stay alive and the fishes that you grab that add 10 points to your score.</p>
 <p>The game was made with Canvas in JS and the images of the elements and the background were found on Google and itch.io, respectvely.</p>
 <p>My biggest difficulties in the execution of this game was the implementation of jump mechanics and its variables, like adding gravity and friction simulations, adding collision to the obstacles, and arranging correctly the methods created for my objects.</p>

 <p>To test my game you only need to acess the link to the GitHub Page below, or download the repository and execute the index.html file on the browser.</p>
